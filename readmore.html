    <p>Hi, my name is Sam. I am a programmer, I am proficient in python, I can do a moderate amount of c# for the backend of unity, html & css (I coded this website in raw html and css). <br></p>
    <h2>My journey:</h2>
<p>    I first got intrested in programming when I was 6 and I started using the offline editor for <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu", target="blank">scratch</a>, on my 10th birthday (2017) I made an <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/IronHead43/">my online scratch account</a> and I started sharing and viewing projects.<br>
    I shared some quite intresting projects, I made my own designs of a GUI OS called Iron OS, I made a 2D digger game called dig down and much more. After a year 1/2 on scratch it was now half way through 2018 I started playing minecraft, I collaborated with some people and decided to open up a <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms-plus/" target="blank">minecraft realm</a><br>
    I got really intrested by command blocks (like 3D programming) & redstone (like electricity) and started creating games with command blocks for people to play and massive redstone computers that could run arithmatic calculations. I also coded a website for the server that taught me html and css (which I made a <a href="https://github.com/IronHead43/lcWebsite" target="blank">github repo</a> for after I shut it down).<br>
    Half way through running my realm/server (called LightCraft) I returned to scratch for a few months and I finished my biggest scratch project I ever made, which I had started in 2018 called Blocky that was a block based programming language that ran inside of scratch. I actually made a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/blocky-scratch/blocky">website for it in google sites as well</a>. this is the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/348937075/">original project</a><br>
    I already had blender3d, unity & python installed on my computer after that and I knew roughly how python worked so I started creating apps in unity and publishing them to the google playstore. I have also been working on python projects and uploading them to a <a href="https://github.com/IronHead43/python", target="blank">github repo</a><br></p>

LightCraft was a massive part of my life that taught me Leadership skills and some about programming, the server actually started in September 2019 just after my 11th birthday and ended in October 2020. I was playing a minecraft (a sandbox game) world and I invited some friends from online, we kept doing it and we built a city. I was the mayor and more and more people joined, there was about 4 main people who always joined so I decided to start a proper server hosted by Microsoft called a realm so we can play when I am not online.
                        For the first 6 months I didn't share it online I just asked members if they had friends and invited them and invited their friends. We built awesome things and I coded games for them to play and I learn a lot, I even built a full redstone computer which I dubbed the purple-bit (see Fig 0.3). Then I realised the realm had a code that people could enter in to join and I didn't have to manually invite everyone! I posted the code on the minecraft forums and a few people started joining, by then it already had about 300 members.
                        I then discovered a subreddit (communities on a social media called Reddit) that let you share minecraft realms, I would occasianly share LightCraft there, my realm had fully fledged games like the massive servers so lots of people wanted to join it and lots of people tried to rip it off and it quickly shot past 1000 members. I was working on many new stuff and I had a team on there of builders & moderators. 
                        It started getting hard, one time I had to fire someone because they had gone corrupt for one reason or another and they some even started coups against me that was very stressful staying up calming hundreds of people down at 1am at 12 years old and other servers wanted me to fail so they could get more members and they often backstabbed me. One time I remember I took a weekend away 
                    on a school trip with no internet, everyone assured me that it would be fine so I explained everything and put the best person in charge. But when I got back our name had been tarnished in the realm community and the other ones were trash talking us, I joined the realm and a hacker had set everything on fire but I had made a backup thankfully. Another time I left school and I turned on my phone to over <i>6000 notifications!</i> from discord (a social media service), I was thinking something must be seriously messed up and I quickly checked the LightCraft discord server
                which had gone from 900 members to 300 in a few hours when I was trying to beat the record of 1000 members! There were 9999+ notifications in every channel, hundreds of channels were made, more and more people were leaving while I was acting. I realised straight away this was a raid, there was a bot spamming every channel with an @everyone ping, an admin had added it and created the max amount of channels.
            I acted quick and banned the bot. I started deleting channels, when I got home I got on a voice call with a staff and carried on deleting for 2 more hours, then we got a bot to purge all the messages. The raider had messaged me during school telling me it was him, I did actually report him to discord but nothing happened,
            he said he was hired by a competing realm for 105$ to raid my discord. What he did was he was pretty good at programming (for a minecraft realm developer) and he had an intervew with me and the head developer where we decided he was good. He could do javascript (which I guess he used to make the bot) & create minecraft mods.
            We never fully recovered from that raid. Members kept leaving in droves faster than they were joining for months and we got down to 100 members, when we managed to get about 700 members again on discord (by then we had about 7000 unique realm members, not including ones that had left) I had enough of LightCraft (November 2019). It had become really good amd people were started to get angry at me wherever I went and I felt like people took it for granted.
            Though when I shut it down I got thousands of messages for months telling me to repon it until I finally decided to do it again in about March 2020 (while I was away from LightCraft I made Blocky). As soon as I opened it again everyone joined within hours without me even messaging them. And one of the staff that had earlier led a large coup against me even managing to get a few staff involved in it since he would give out free items consntantly so everyone liked him and he could get away with whatever he wanted so people just thought I was unfair and got mad when I stopped him saying I didn't care about the server when actually the opposite was true. But he promised he would never do it again and he had become more mature with other people testifying to it so I unbanned him.
            I gave people moderator ect again but everyone was asking me to make him moderator, I was weary of him but they said they had played with him since then (which seems like a bit of a redflag to be honest looking back on it now) and he was better so I made him moderator. But him and another moderator were going corrupt, giving out items to get people to like them and if I stepped in everyone got angry, they even spammed me and my little sister to kill ourselves, one of them even was trading ch**d p*** I decided to fire them. They started getting really angry in the general channel (the channel all members talks on) on the discord server
            lots of people saw this and liked him because they gave out items so took their side and said I had "turned corrupt". They made a discord server of 50 people of just hating on me. Even lots of the staff liked them, a few understood why I fired them but just prefered them to me and joined the hate group hating me mindlessly. They also lied about why I banned them to everyone to make me seem worse. Each day more and more of the staff team left once the first one did a ton did, this was all happening just around the time
            we were transfering to a server (different from a realm which is owned by Microsoft) that could host 50 people instead of 10 people but I hadn't advertised it as well and almost all the original people left or had now decided to go inactive and new people weren't really joining. At the begining it was just me and my sister with a few random members playing on the server, a harsh change from constantly being full to at peak hours have 2 online. But after about a week we got randomly put at the front of a server listing app! It caused about 1 person to join every hour, still not as much as when we were a realm
            , but we managed to get maybe 500 people from that app. About 20 turned out to be really dedicated players, we started competing with this server that had been running for a few years independently not on microsofts servers. We managed to beat their record of 5 players in our second week but for some reason they saw us as rivals and often tried to spy on us, we ran this server until about August 2020 but I realised Realms were just better since the server market was too saturated
            even though I could download plugins from online I enjoyed creating my own games on realms, which I couldn't do with this since it ran PHP software (I can't program in PHP) however using Microsoft realms I could do command blocks (minecrafts built in programming language). I got my first job as a software engineer a few days before my 13th birthday working for a minecraft team called Leedpro doing command blocks for their official maps that they sold on the minecraft store (around July 2020). When I reopened the realm I decided I wanted to learn how to make texture packs and behaviour packs (they change how the game looks and modify things like how bats move, their hit box, adding new entities ect).
            So I created my own 3D models of npcs, of the LightCraft logo and imported them to the realm then made it so it would be better than ever but the problem was there weren't really any staff and I didn't feel much motivation anymore. I wanted to do something more worthwile. I stopped logging on to the realm for a few weeks and it felt good until I just shut it down and deleted the discord just after we reached our goal of 600 members.<a href="index.html">read less</a>></h3>
