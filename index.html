        <center><h1>My Portfolio:</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Sam. I am a programmer, I am proficient in python, I can do a moderate amount of c# for the backend of unity, html & css (I coded this website in raw html and css). <br></p>
    <h2>My journey:</h2>
<p>    I first got intrested in programming when I was 6 and I started using the offline editor for <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu", target="blank">scratch</a>, on my 10th birthday (2017) I made an <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/IronHead43/">my online scratch account</a> and I started sharing and viewing projects.<br>
    Some projects I shared included, designs of a GUI OS called Iron OS, and a 2D digger game called dig down. After a year 1/2 on scratch it was now half way through 2018 I started playing minecraft, I collaborated with some people and decided to open up a <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms-plus/" target="blank">minecraft realm</a><br>
    I got really intrested by command blocks (like 3D programming) & redstone (like electricity) and started creating games with command blocks for people to play and massive redstone computers that could run arithmatic calculations. I also coded a website for the server that taught me html and css (which I made a <a href="https://github.com/IronHead43/lcWebsite" target="blank">github repo</a> for after I shut it down).<br>
    Half way through running my realm/server (called LightCraft) I returned to scratch for a few months and I finished my biggest scratch project I ever made, which I had started in 2018 called Blocky that was a block based programming language that ran inside of scratch. I actually made a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/blocky-scratch/blocky">website for it in google sites as well</a>. this is the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/348937075/">original project</a><br>
    I already had blender3d, unity & python installed on my computer after that and I knew roughly how python worked so I started creating apps in unity and publishing them to the google playstore. I have also been working on python projects and uploading them to a <a href="https://github.com/IronHead43/python", target="blank">github repo</a><br></p>
