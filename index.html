    <p>Hi, I am a programmer, I am proficient in python, I can do a moderate amount of c# for the backend of unity, html & css (I coded this website in raw html and css). <br></p>
    <h2>My journey:</h2>
<p>    I first got intrested in programming when I was 6 and I started using the offline editor for <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu", target="blank">scratch</a>, on my 10th birthday (2017) I made an <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/IronHead43/">my online scratch account</a> and I started sharing and viewing projects.<br>
    I shared some quite intresting projects, I made my own designs of a GUI OS called Iron OS, I made a 2D digger game called dig down and much more. After a year 1/2 on scratch it was now half way through 2018 I started playing minecraft, I collaborated with some people and decided to open up a <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms-plus/" target="blank">minecraft realm</a><br>
    I got really intrested by command blocks (like 3D programming) & redstone (like electricity) and started creating games with command blocks for people to play and massive redstone computers that could run arithmatic calculations. I also coded a website for the server that taught me html and css (which I made a <a href="https://github.com/IronHead43/lcWebsite" target="blank">github repo</a> for after I shut it down).<br>
    Half way through running my realm/server (called LightCraft) I returned to scratch for a few months and I finished my biggest scratch project I ever made, which I had started in 2018 called Blocky that was a block based programming language that ran inside of scratch. I actually made a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/blocky-scratch/blocky">website for it in google sites as well</a>. this is the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/348937075/">original project</a><br>
    I already had blender3d, unity & python installed on my computer after that and I knew roughly how python worked so I started creating apps in unity and publishing them to the google playstore. I have also been working on python projects and uploading them to a <a href="https://github.com/IronHead43/python", target="blank">github repo</a><br></p>

                <h3>Lightcraft was a massive part of my life that taught me Leadership skills and some about programming, the server actually started in September 2019 just after my 11th birthday and ended in October 2020. I was playing a minecraft (a sandbox game) world and I invited some friends from online, we kept doing it and we built a city. I was the mayor and more and more people joined, there was about 4 main people who always joined so I decided to start a proper server hosted by Microsoft called a realm so we can play when I am not on
                    for the first 6 months I didn't post i online I just asked people if they had friends and invited them and invited their friends. We built awesome things and I coded games for them to play and I learn a lot, I even built a full redstone computer which I dubbed the purple-bit. Then I discovered the realm had a code and I didn't have to manually invite everyone! I posted the code on the minecraft forums and a few people started joining, by then it had about 300 members.
                    I then discovered a subreddit that let you share minecraft realms, I would occasianly post mine there, my realm had fully fledged games like the massive servers so lots of people wanted to join it and lots of people tried to rip it off and it quickly shot past 1000 members. I was working on many new stuff and I had a team on there of builders & moderators. 
                    It was very hard when I had to fire one because they had gone corrupt for one reason or another and they some even started coups against me that was very stressful staying up calming hundreds of people down at 1am at 12 years old and other servers wanted me to fail so they could get more members and they often backstabbed me. One time I remember I took a weekend alway 
                on camp with no internet, everyone assured me that it would be fine so I explained everything and put the best person in charge. But when I got back our name had been tarnished in the realm community and the other ones were trash talking us, I joined the realm and a hacker had set everything on fire but I had made a backup thankfully. Another time I float:left school and I turned on my phone to over <i>6000 notifications!</i> from discord (a social media service), something must be seriously messed up and I quickly checked my discord server
            which had gone from 900 members to 300 in a few hours when I was trying to beat the record of 1000! <a href="readmore.html">read more</a></h3>
